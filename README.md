# tei-editor
Sandbox for tei forms. Built in eXistdb, uses xsltforms and xsltforms specific javascript. 

POC only, not fully functional. Current implementation relys heavily on srophe-data [https://github.com/srophe/srophe-app-data]  and possibly some work from srophe-eXist-app [https://github.com/srophe/srophe-eXist-app].
